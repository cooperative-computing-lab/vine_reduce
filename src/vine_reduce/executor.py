"""Implementations of the pipeline's `executor` step: the callable
executor_wrapper (see defaults.py) invokes to actually run processor(args).
All of these run remotely, at the execution site chosen by the distributor.

simple_executor is the default: it just calls processor(args) directly, in
the same process running executor_wrapper.

cloudpickle_executor and dask_executor are alternatives:
  - cloudpickle_executor runs processor(args) in its own subprocess (via
    CloudpickleProcessPoolExecutor), so a crash or memory leak in processor
    doesn't take down the worker task itself.
  - dask_executor expects processor(args) to return a dask-delayed object
    (or dask array/dataframe) and computes it at the execution site, using
    dask's "processes" scheduler backed by CloudpickleProcessPoolExecutor -
    so tasks inside the dask graph may be closures/lambdas too, same as
    cloudpickle_executor. dask is not a vine_reduce dependency; it must
    already be installed wherever this executor actually runs.
