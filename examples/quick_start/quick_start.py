"""Quick-start tutorial: vine_reduce over real files via the TaskVine executor.

vine_reduce runs a MapReduce-style computation over one or more named
"datasets" (see build_datasets below for their shape). For each (processor,
dataset) pair, it:

  1. Splits every file in the dataset into contiguous chunks of entries and
     runs the processor (the "map" step) on each chunk, remotely, as a
     TaskVine task. numbers_chunk_to_args below is what turns a chunk into
     the actual arguments a processor receives.
  2. Collects the processor outputs into a pool, then repeatedly folds
     batches of pooled results together with a "reducer" (the "reduce"
     step) - also remotely - producing fewer, larger partial results each
     round, until one final result covers the whole dataset. This example
     doesn't pass a custom reducer, so vine_reduce uses its default: `a +=
     b`, i.e. plain addition, which is exactly what you want when a
     processor's output (here, an int) already knows how to combine with
     another of its own kind.
  3. Writes that final result to results_dir, one file per (dataset,
     processor) pair (see load_result below), and along the way
     checkpoints intermediate reduce outputs to checkpoint_dir so a
     crashed run can resume without recomputing chunks it already
     finished.

None of this requires knowing TaskVine's own vocabulary (managers, workers,
tasks) beyond what it takes to start one: main() below constructs a
TaskVineDistributor (vine_reduce's TaskVine-backed executor, wrapping a
TaskVine manager) and a single local worker via vine.Factory, so `python
quick_start.py` runs standalone - no cluster, no separate worker process to
launch by hand.

Concretely, in this example:

- write_test_data.py generates two datasets of three binary files each,
  under examples/quick_start/data/, freshly on every run. Each file holds
  50-100 random positive 4-byte integers packed with struct. Datasets are
  built with each file's *absolute* path (computed at run time) as its
  "files" key, since the TaskVine workers below run as separate processes
  that only share a filesystem with this one - not its working directory
  or relative paths.
- Three processors act as the map step, run over both datasets: one sums
  only even numbers, one sums only odd numbers, one sums everything.
- At the end, the six result files (2 datasets x 3 processors) are loaded
  back into memory and checked for internal consistency: odd + even must
  equal all.
